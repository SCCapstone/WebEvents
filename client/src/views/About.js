                        We have created an app that will provide an optimal schedule of event attendees based on their mutual
                        preferences for dates and times. The app user would be the event organizer. Our app will have a web-page
                        take an input of an excel file that has scheduling preferences and output a schedule that has
                        scheduled clients based on their preferences. The target audience is event organizers who need to
                        schedule a lot of people in a set period of time while attempting to make event speakers happy with
                        their scheduled times.<br/>
